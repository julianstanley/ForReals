# Vectors

## Section Goals

The more overarching goal of this section is to complete the first goal in the 18.02 syllabus:

{% hint style="success" %}
Fluency with vector operations, including vector proofs and the ability to translate back and forth among the various ways to describe geometric properties, namely, in pictures, in words, in vector notation, and in coordinate notation.
{% endhint %}

In gaining fluency with vector operations, this section will introduce a few technical skills:

determinants of vectors

This section will then build on vector operations
