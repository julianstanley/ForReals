# Vectors

## Section Goals

The more overarching goal of this section is to complete the first goal in the 18.02 syllabus:

{% hint style="success" %}
Fluency with vector operations, including vector proofs and the ability to translate back and forth among the various ways to describe geometric properties, namely, in pictures, in words, in vector notation, and in coordinate notation.
{% endhint %}

In gaining fluency with vector operations, this section will introduce a few technical skills:

* Dot product
* Determinant
* Cross product



### Section 1: Basic operations

Vectors can be described geometrically with a magnitude and direction. Here's an example:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Question V1" %}
a\) A river flows at 3 mph and a rower rows at 6 mph. What heading should the rower take to go straight across a river? b\) Answer the same question if the river flows at 6 mph and the rower rows at 3 mph.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Answer" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
